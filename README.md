C-SharpLiveProject

For a span of two weeks at The Tech Academy, I worked with my peers and instructors on developing a C# MVC Web Application. This website was a 
great opportunity to get real life coding experience, working on tasks for both the front end and the back end. These tasks varied degrees of 
difficulties, giving me the chance to debug, refactor code, and _____.

During the two-week sprint, I gained valuable experience in project management and team programming that I am certain will be useful in future projects.

This interactive website, built with ASP .NET MVC and Entities Framework, serves as a content management system for a theater/acting company. It's designed for easy use by non-technical users to manage website content and productions, manage subscriber logins, and maintain a historical record of past performances and performers.
