**C-SharpLiveProject**
**Introduction:**
For a span of two weeks at The Tech Academy, I worked with my peers and instructors on developing a C# MVC Web Application. This website was a 
great opportunity to get real life coding experience, working on tasks for both the front end and the back end. These tasks varied degrees of 
difficulties, giving me the chance to debug, refactor code, and _____.

During the two-week sprint, I gained valuable experience in project management and team programming that I am certain will be useful in future projects.

"This project is built using ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework. This project is the interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company. It's meant to be a content management service (aka CMS) for users who are not technically savvy and want to easily manage what displays in their website. It's also meant to help manage login capability for subscribers, and maintain a wiki of past performances and performers."

**Back End Tasks:**
  1.) Create Entity Model and CRUD Pages
  2.) Photo Storage and Retrieval
  
Create Entity Model and CRUD pages:
  This task started by creating an entity model for the CastMember class so that cast members can be saved to the database. The next step in this task was
  creating an enum for positions, including roles in a production that can be chosen from a drop down when on the create page. The final step to this 
  was adding CRUD functionality. I used visual studio and EntityFramework to scaffold the CRUD pages (Index, Edit, Create, Details, and Delete) for     
  CastMembers.

Photo Storage and Retrieval:
  In this task, I added functionality so that a user can upload their own photo onto the website via the Create form. After the photo is uploaded, 
  I converted the image to a byte array so that it would be able to be stored in the database. That byte array was then retrieved from the database,
  and converted back into an image where it can be displayed on view.
